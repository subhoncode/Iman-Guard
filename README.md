## 🚫 Pre-Configured Protection

## 🧠 The Science & Wisdom
### 🔘 Why Grayscale?
Research into "Persuasive Design" shows that bright colors act as rewards for the brain. By removing color, you break the neurological feedback loop that keeps you scrolling. [Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/) experts recommend this as a primary tool against digital addiction.

### 🍵 Natural Support
We recommend drinking **Peppermint Tea**. Scientific studies suggest that peppermint can help lower free testosterone levels, providing a natural aid in your journey of self-control and lowering the gaze.

## ⚖️ Spiritual Foundation
### From the Holy Quran:
> "Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do." (Surah An-Nur, 24:30)

### From the Sahih Hadith:
The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "The adultery of the eyes is the looking (at that which is unlawful)." (Sahih Bukhari & Muslim)
